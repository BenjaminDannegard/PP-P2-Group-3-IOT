Introduction
Digital prototypes can be a fantastic asset when testing scenarios, but what I’ve learned in this project is that we have to be careful when setting up our user-tests. Careful consideration on what we want to learn is needed beforehand, in order to get the scenarios right and get useful information.
When we started this project we did the mistake of thinking from a technical perspective instead of exploring the situation. This might be down to excitement, or fear, of finally testing our programming skills.
In the first round, most of our prototypes were very technical based, testing different sounds, lights and vibrations. There were buttons to press, sensors to touch and notifications all based around different devices. In most of our prototypes the user were looking at a screen, pressed a button or a sensor and then something would happen. This is obviously not the best way to test the awareness. But this, we had overlooked in our eager to try as many programming codes as we could think of. This is something to consider as well, it can be very easy to get very engaged with the technical aspects and forget to explore the theoretical features.
What we did learned were also very useful to us, but more from a technical based knowledge. 

Wizard of Oz
In our second round of prototypes we realised that staring at a screen was not going give us any answers of feelings or awareness. So we had set up the tests differently and build more of a scenario.
In our vibration and light test we did a scenario in a group members home. A user, familiar with the Chromecast, holding a phone and a bag in their hand walked into a room. The door was closed to simulate the feeling of walking into a hotel room. We deliberately chose users that had not visited the group members home before so that the user would have a similar feeling as he/she would have had walking into a hotel room for the first time.
In this test we decided not to give the user any other information than they where visiting a hotel for the first time.
Inside the room a Arduino with LED’s was hidden behind the Tv, in the same place as you would find a Chromecast. The phone had the messages set to a vibration pattern that matched the blinking LED’s. As the user got closer to the TV, I could send a text to the users phone via IFTT and web socket as the same time as the lights on the Arduino would start blinking. When setting up a scenario like this the testing worked much better. 
What I’ve learned in this project is how we set up testing is very depended to what we want to learn.
