Coding is an extremely versatile and useful tool to be used with prototyping. Coding in itself can be useful, but combining it with the Arduino board makes it even more useful especially for a prototyping purpose. Being able to utilize code in the physical plane gives us a lot of possibilities when developing prototypes. For example one of the prototypes I developed for the course required a sensor to detect the proximity of a user and I was able to accomplish this complex task fairly easily with the help of the Arduino board and code. Also to realize the scenario for this prototype I had to simulate a TV screen and the animation on the screen, so I used code to make a website that would fulfill this purpose. Considering how popular screens are and how frequently we encounter screens in our everyday life, it seems that coding will only become more important to test future prototypes.

It is hard to think of any negative aspects code can have. I have not yet encountered any situation that made me think negatively of coding in a prototyping aspect. Neither have I felt restricted by coding in any aspect. But what I could imagine happening is that you take the easy way out with coding and don't explore other mediums enough when developing prototypes.

An important aspect that you should have in mind when using code to prototype is that it will most likely be used on a device which limits the scenario setting when testing your prototype. For example, when I tested my prototype it was required to have the Arduino board connected to a computer and to display my website on my computer. I found that setting the scene in a way to gather the information I wanted to be difficult. It may also be difficult for the user to imagine themselves in a scenario when forced to focus on a screen. Especially in my case where the screen was not supposed to be the focus of the test but something the user should notice on their own after triggering a sensor. Testing this was difficult, but the impossible part was when I was going to test a modification of the prototype on the same user that tested the last version. This might not be as big of a problem when testing more ambiguous physical prototypes where users can project more onto an object. This may present a hindrance that may be inherent to the coding medium, that the things you develop with code are not ambiguous enough and gives too much detail for some prototyping purposes.
