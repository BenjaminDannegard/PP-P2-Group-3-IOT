As a total beginner to programming in the start of this programme I had yet to realise the freedom programming lends a designer. Specifically a designer of digital products.        Through the years, I have had a lot of ideas in the non-physical world. This because there is so much more to explore in that area. Everything that humans have needed before has been made countless of times. There are a thousand iterations of every chair, lamp, whisk, and pot out there. I feel like this is this the only space where we can create something truly novel, while identifying the upcoming needs of humans 2018 and forward.       The problem with having all these ideas back then, is that they would require coding for me to realise them. I thought if only I had a friend or a partner who’s great at building apps and websites, we could really accomplish things. That was the attitude I entered this programme with, that this would be where I find that companion. So far, I haven’t found that person, but through Programming 1 and 2 I think I found something equally as valuable. These courses have really sparked my own interest in Html, CSS, JS and programming generally.        In this final assignment, the most relevant work I did that relates to this course revolves around the x3 note prototype. And while it remains a very simple experiment to explore chords, notes and connectivity, I still think it suffices to reflect upon in this context. The challenge with the prototype was to get three different notes to play on three different devices in a succession, all of them running the same code. To accomplish this we used websockets to establish a connection between the devices. Adapting Clints sample code, we made it so that devices receiving a message will play a note.  To get the three devices to each play a different one, we came up with the idea to use their OS and device information that would be available to us through JS, to distinguish the devices from each other. I think this demonstrates quite well how the technique we used affects the prototype and experience in a significant way. I am sure there is a better way to accomplish the same result, but because of our restrictions, users are required to use a smartphone, a Mac and a PC to test it out. Another restriction had us put in a second way to call the function that plays the notes. The android phones we used to try this out, don’t allow sound to be triggered from an outside source. The same button we use to send a message to the other devices was made to also have an onclick also calling the same function. So to get the all three notes to play on the each device, a message has to be sent from the smartphone. Making it the only device you can control the action properly with.        As I hope to have made clear with my examples, I’ve found that ones programming knowledge can be very restrictive in how you are forced to solve problems. As well as showing how this can alter the experience users have, with what you create. I feel like this restriction compels you to be creative with the abilities you have and motivates you to learn more. So that in the end you can become your own partner, with the freedom to realise any idea that comes to you.
