In the physical prototyping project, we were tasked to explore how Google Chromecast can express its availability without being intrusive in an environment. 

In order to understand the situation, coding was one of the effective tools I used to explore and understand the design problem.

The initial prototype I built for the first test was static because it was built with cardboard. Using this prototype I was able to investigate how much people know about Chromecast.

Although static prototypes are important in some user case scenarios but it was limited when I wanted to test scenarios that are dynamic like triggering a sound or light when a user is in certain location in a room.

Coding is very useful in prototyping because of its versatility. It can be used to prototype web applications, mobile applications and any kind of application that will create a real life scenario for user engagement, user interaction and the ability to get meaningful feedback that will help to understand the design problem.

The interesting part of coding is when it is combined with a hardware device like arduino, there is no limit to what can be prototyped with these tools. A case in sight was when I was able to prototype a TV set that vibrates when a user enters a room. The TV and sensor were far away and the test was conducted with different scenarios and context in mind. Using this prototype successfully, further validates how important coding is in prototyping both tangible and intangible objects that convey messages.

Although during the prototyping phase in the project, I did not experience any situation that I wanted to prototype and test for that I was not able to do, rather I felt with coding I had more power.

One of the user test scenarios I prototyped during the project was a system of connected devices. The communication was between a server, arduino and a mobile device that triggers flashlight by user event. This kind of complex test situation would have been very difficult to prototype without the help of code and arduino device.

Using coding to prototype can open a new world, but when code is not deployed effectively or there is an unidentified bug in the code it can hinder the prototyping process and in some cases produce false result. A case in hand is when I was testing a light pattern but it happens that I had a bug in my code that went unnoticed. During user testing, I was able to discovered that it produced wrong results due to a bug. I was able to fix the bug and rerun the test. It was clear how the result was quite different.

The different prototypes I built at different stages of the application helped me to understand the user situation and open new area to explore and also let me dig deeper into what has been known. A case in hand is when I tested light intensity. With the help of potentiometer and arduino, I was able to control the light intensity on the test device. The user testing was done with the amount of light in the scene in consideration. The prototype through user testing was able to give us some insight on how the amount of light in a certain scenario correlates with the intensity of an indicator light on a device
